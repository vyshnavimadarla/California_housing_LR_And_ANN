# California_housing_LR_And_ANN
Model building and comparison between Linear Regression and ANN models using California Housing dataset.

Learning Outcomes and findings of this model building. 
Dataset: Utilized the California Housing dataset, which contains various features related to housing in California. Loaded the dataset using scikit-learn:

Tasks:

--Data Preprocessing:
Explore and understand the features of the dataset.
Handle any missing values or outliers if present.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

--Linear Regression:
Implement a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
Train the model on the training set.
Make predictions on the testing set.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate regression metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R2 Score).

--Artificial Neural Network (ANN):
Implement a simple ANN for regression using a framework like TensorFlow or Keras.
Design the architecture of the neural network, including the input and output layers.
Train the ANN on the training set.
Make predictions on the testing set.
Evaluate the model's performance using the same regression metrics used for Linear Regression.

--Comparison and Analysis:
Compare the performance metrics of the Linear Regression and ANN models.
Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
Analyze whether the complexity of an ANN provides better predictive performance compared to Linear Regression.

--Visualization:
Create visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, line plots) to compare the predicted values of the two models with the actual values.
Visualize the model architectures if possible.

--Conclusion:
Summarize the key findings.
Provide insights into which model performed better for predicting house prices in the California Housing dataset.
Discuss any challenges encountered during the implementation.
